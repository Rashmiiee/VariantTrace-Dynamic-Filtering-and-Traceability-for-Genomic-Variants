This is an in-house variant filtering app to enable standardization and future traceability for filtering variants across patient samples.

The app can handle large converted vcf files. The app takes in a csv or tsv file and allows for dynamic filtering while showing the users the applied filters. The applied filters are logged in the order of their selection by the user with a timestamp on them.
